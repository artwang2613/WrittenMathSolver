# WrittenMathSolver
An image recognition CNN that reads handwritten, simple math expressions and solves them, can be used by teachers to grade tests quickly.

I did this for a 48 hour Hackathon. Needless to say I went too far into the rabbit hole on this one and by the 24 hour mark of no sleep my brain started doing weird things. This is not completed, nor does it work. My brain at the time refused to understand the partial derivatives for the back propagation and I think there are bunch of other errors. As such, its so mangled I don't think i'm going to touch this thing again for a long while.
