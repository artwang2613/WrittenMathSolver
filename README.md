# WrittenMathSolver
An image recognition CNN writen scratch that reads handwritten, simple math expressions and solves them, can be used by teachers to grade tests quickly.

I did this for a 48 hour Hackathon. This is not completed, nor does it work properly. At that time I didn't understand the partial derivatives for the back propagation and there are other errors related to forward propagation.

Look at CNNTest and SimpleNN for newer versions that are undergoing work currently.
