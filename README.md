# WrittenMathSolver
An image recognition CNN that reads handwritten, simple math expressions and solves them, can be used by teachers to grade tests quickly.

I did this for a 48 hour Hackathon. By the 24 hour mark of no sleep my brain started doing weird things. This is not completed, nor does it work. At that time I didn't understand the partial derivatives for the back propagation and I think there are bunch of other errors.

Look at CNNTest and SimpleNN for newer versions that are undergoing work currently.
